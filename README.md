Welcome to AutoEdge|TheFactory, the next evolution of the Progress|OpenEdge best practises reference application AutoEdge. AutoEdge|TheFactory introduces SaaS concepts to the OpenEdge Reference Implementation and is class based. The aim of this project is to act as a learning aid for those who work with the OpenEdge ABL and wish to see it's capabilities in action.

AutoEdge|TheFactory is an extension of the existing use cases illustrated by AutoEdge. Where AutoEdge is based upon the business functions of an automobile dealer, AutoEdge|TheFactory is based upon the business functions of an automobile manufacturer supplying vehicles to dealers.

More details, documents and discussions are available on the AutoEdge|TheFactory community of Progress Communities.
